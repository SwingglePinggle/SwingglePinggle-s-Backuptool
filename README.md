Welcome to Backup Tool v0.5

Hello this is my first very published script on github. This small collection of rough script that makes up a backup tool program was  made for my own personal use.Feel free to modify it as you see fit. I'm not responsible for damage to your personal computer if you download this program. This program currently only works for Fedora based distros

Installation is Fairly simple: just download the zip file Then run the startnw.sh script. It will make some directories and files to run other scripts. It will ask for root privileges. Make Sure that you run the startnw.sh scripts that it's in the Downloads directory. If somehow startnw.sh doesn't work. Extract the Zip file to your /home/<your username> directory. Make a folder called .data at your /home directory.In the .data directory make Data1.txt, and a Data2.txt file. In Data1.txt put your username in and in Data2.txt put the command for your local package manager.

The Backup Tool V0.5 currently only backups the Documents directory and a directory called Scripts. It installs the unzip and zip programs. Optionally it can install the Brave Browser or  Stable Wine Branch
